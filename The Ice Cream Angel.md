#The Ice Cream Angel (Just So You Know)

>One man is on journey to see that every child gets their ice cream fix.

Every summer, the sweetest sound to many children's ears is the **jingle** of the ice cream **truck**. Sadly, however, not all kids can **afford** their favorite summertime treat. One man, **though**, has found a way to make sure no child goes without this cold **dessert**.

James Karagiannis has been cycling around the **inner-city** **neighborhoods** of Buffalo, New York, **selling** **frozen** **treats** for **nearly** a **decade**. He kept his prices low, just US$1 for an ice cream bar or a cone. If by chance a kid couldn't afford it, he would ask them a math or history question instead. If they got it right, they ate for free. It was a nice gesture and a great way to promote education, but he couldn't keep it up forever due to the cost involved. So, he found another way.
